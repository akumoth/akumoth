I'm a Venezuelan Python programmer in the area of Data Science, specializing not just in data analysis and visualization but also in data warehouse creation & management. I like to use graphic design and visual language to facilitate communicating complicated knowledge and dense, varied data in a simple, didactic and easy to understand manner.

Currently learning Godot and looking to collaborate and work on new projects and opportunities that'll help me learn more and strengthen my skillset.
